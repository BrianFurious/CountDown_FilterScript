Version 1: 24/08/2011 [dd/mm/yyyy] - First Release

Version 1.1: 
                 - The countdown will print on your 'samp-server'. [Useful for who don't want to open SAMP and refresh the server to see the countdown everysecond. ]
                 - Fixed the countdown when goes to hour 0 it printed -1

Version 1.1 R1: Fixed the countdown when goes to hour 0 and minute 0 it printed - sometime 0 or -1 to hour and 60 to minutes

Version 1.x Final
              - I finnaly fixed all the issues about CountDown and printing.
              - Now the countdown will be around 96% perfect in the count.
              - When the countdown goes to hour 0, minute 0, seconds 0. [Will open the server with your Original Server Name. Remember to set it in the FS]

Version 2
             - Now the filterscript will be unloaded when the countdown finish beacuse it's being useless after it. [Not completed yet cause of some issues.]
             - Now the CountDown will save every hour, minute, second thanks to DINI by DragoneBlue. [ Very useful if you want to restart/make offline for some seconds your GameMode without losing your countdown. When the countdown will go to 0h 0m 0s, the FS will load the default time made in the script. ]
             - More precision in countdown it will be around 98-99% [Laste Update was a bit late. On 1 hour of countdown it was about 1 minute late. ]
             - Fixed the issue when you close the 'server-samp' at the same time as 0h 0m 0s it saved a negative random number. [Useful fix beacause if you start the server and the file have a negative number will countdown it instead the normai. ]
             - Little thanks to Valve Secure beacause of save disk space [1 day = about 50mb is not useful]. Now it's optional.
